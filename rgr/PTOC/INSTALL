This archive contains executable files 'ptoc' and 'cganal' 
compiled for Linux. If you want to build coverter on some other
platform or you have done some changes in sources and want to
rebuild converter just run make. It seems to me that converter 
code is almost platform independent. Makefile for Microsoft
Visual C++ is also available. 

To build converter just try "make". Converter consists of two
excutable files: "ptoc" - converter itself and "cganal" - analyzer
of call graph (see README), runtime library "libptoc.a", configuration file
for converter "ptoc.cfg", Pascal header for converter "ptoc.pas"
and include file for all converted sources "ptoc.h".
To run converter you should only specify path to directory with "ptoc"
and "cganal". To compile and link converted files you should
specify for compiler and linker path to header file "ptoc.h" and
library "libptoc.a". 
   
For example, I have used converter in following way: 

rm */*.[ch] call.grp
for name in */*.pas
do
$(PTOC_DIR)ptoc -I include -in $name -c -analyze -intset -init -unsigned 
done
cganal
