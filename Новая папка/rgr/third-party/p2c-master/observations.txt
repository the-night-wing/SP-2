p2c CONVERTOR
--------------
mapping is done as follows:
1) constants :-  # defines 	a.pas
2) integer	long int	a.pas
3) float	double		b.pas
4) function name is retained	c.pas
5) program xxxx   statt is ignored	a.pas,b.pas,c.pas
6) when there is no function or proc defined the variables are treated as locals of main() , else they are made global vars	b.pas and c.pa
7) all functions are declared static    b.aps and c.pas
8) when a function returns a value, in C a variable "Result"  is added which is the variable representing the funciton name in pascal.. "Result" is returned in C program			d.pas

9)BUG!!!!
	see e.pas  .. Result is a local var in func .. getting duplictely declared in e.c.......  you can't Use Result as a var in your program!!



10) in typedefs    the origional definition is used to declared variables and not the typedefs....( why??)
			f.pas

11) a symantically incorrect program is translated into symantically incorrect one
12) undefinded vars cause warning only .. but still it is translated

13) additional parameter in the form of a link to the local variables of function ( which was enclosing in the pascal code ) in C is passed to a called function to stimulate the block structure of pascal!!!
